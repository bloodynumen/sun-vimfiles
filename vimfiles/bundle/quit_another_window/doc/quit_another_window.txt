                                                   *quit_another_window*

There's one optional dependency: CmdAlias plugin (vimscript #746).

If CmdAlias is installed, then lowercased aliases of commands will be available.
I found it useful.

DESCRIPTION                            *quit_another_window-description*

Often i need to close some other window and keep working in current window.
For example, if i read some help in upper window, and i edit code in lower
window. In the definite moment i decide to close help window. To do it,
i have to press "Ctrl_W k :q".

Not very short. And this is not the worse variant.
Other variant:

+-----------------+-----------------+
|      help       |                 |
|     window      |                 |
|                 |     current     |
+-----------------+     window      |
|                 |                 |
|                 | <cursor>        |
|                 |                 |
|                 |                 |
+-----------------+-----------------+

Focus is in the 'current window', cursor is on the <cursor> sign. 
I want to close 'help window' and keep working in current window.

That's what i need to do: 

Ctrl_W h Ctrl_W k :q Ctrl_W l

This is very long!
So, i wrote this plugin to make it easy.

It provides 5 commands.

Firstly, four commands for most-frequently actions:

      :Qh means "close left window and go back"
      :Qj means "close lower window and go back"
      :Qk means "close upper window and go back"
      :Ql means "close right window and go back"

And one universal command:
      :Q <args>, where <args> is movement commands to needed window.
      
      For example, ":Q hk" means "Go to the left window, then go to upper window,
                                  close it and go back to source window"

      So, this long long command "Ctrl_W h Ctrl_W k :q Ctrl_W l"
      is truncated to short expression: ":Q hk"

Other useful shortcut for the universal command can be overridden via
specifying:

      nmap <silent> <C-z> <Plug>QAnotherWin

<C-z> is default. This shortcut waits you enter h,j,k,l as much as you want
and finish your command with <Space>. The result will be same as :Q <args> but
faster.

About CmdAlias plugin: if CmdAlias is installed (vimscript #746), then five lowercased
aliases of commands is available: :qh, :qj, :qk, :ql, :q <args>.

Please NOTE: 

1) if :Q without arguments is passed, then current window becomes closed.
   (to provide compatibility of lowercased command :q)

2) If argument is passed, but target window is the same as current window, then
   no window will be closed.
